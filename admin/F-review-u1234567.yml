    The test's basic structure is right. As an example, it contains the @Rule part to determine
  the condition of the code passes the test, which is that the output equals to the expected value.
  In the second part of the test, it listed some conditions that fit for the requirments of passing
  the test and the conditions were classified to 11 parts, each part starts with different letter
  from a to j.
    The codes are well-documented in java class and the basic structure of this class and method
  is right.
    The method is named in "PlacementToRotationTest" and matches the name of this class. The only
  variable of in this method is called "out", which is the third character of the input string.
  Through the whole program, this variable is used throughout and the name was never changed through
  the class.
    However, this test only contains a part of all examples of the strings of the entire placements.
  Although each part of the examples of test contains all possibilities of the third character, for
  the other characters in the input string it also has other possibilities which weren't been written.
  As an example, the placement "a010" was not listed. So the test can only test a part of the whole
  example but not all.
