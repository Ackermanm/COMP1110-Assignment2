comments:
    - First of all, the thing that is well done by the author is that he classified all of the
    - entire conditions in this task and possibilities appropriately. For example, the state of
    - the placement is correctly divided into three conditions, including "null", "the remainder
    - divided by 4 equals to 0" and "the i*th character of the placement listed before is equal
    - to the j*th character of the placement, which is the same placement as the placement declared
    - before the method. The clearly division helps to finish this task much more conveniently and
    - effectively.
    - I think that the codes are totally well-documented in java class and the basic structure of
    - this class and method is correctly typed.
    - The method is named in "isPlacementStringWellFormed". The name is proper and it also matches
    - the name of this class, so there will not be any error declared in the terminal when we try to
    - run this method. The varialble in this method is called "placement" and the name of it is never
    - changed during the whole period of the method.
    - As the method written by the author has passed all the test that required to pass, no bugs and
    - error are concluded in this method. But I think that one thing could still be improved, which is
    - that the word "i = i + 4" could be simplified into "i += 4". "i = i + 4" is also correct of course,
    - but I think more simple declaration leads to less time of running the program.
