    I think the best features of this code is that it use the if statement clearly and correctly.
  The whole class was divided into two main conditions, which are "the 'notPlacedPieceType' is
  not null and is not empty" and the size of the set that declared before is 0, which means that
  the set is empty and contains nothing. In the first condition, it is also classified to two
  small conditions including "tempCol is greater or equal to 0 and tempRow is also greater or
  equal to 0" and " the 'putPieceString' is empty". In conclusion, the process of classfing all
  the different conditions is well done.
    As far as I concern, all of the codes in this method are well-documented in java class type
  and the basic structure of this class and method is correctly written. Which was a good work
  done by the author.
    The name of this method is named as getViablePiecePlacements, which is same as the name of
  this java class. Many variables are contained in this method, ranging from "notPlacedPieceType"
  in string type to "tempCol" and "tempRow" in integer type. All of the varaibles declared in the
  method were used correctly and properly, the names have never been changed in the whole part of
  the method.
    About the bug and the error of this class, as it has passed the test which has been provided
  by the lecturer, I do not think it contains any error or bug need to be fixed. The only thing
  that may able to be improved is the complexity of the codes.
